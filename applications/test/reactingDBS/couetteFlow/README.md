## Physical Problems

The Couette flow is also a channel flow similar to the Poiseuille flow, but the flow is now driven by the upper plate moving along the x direction with a constant velocity u0 instead of a constant force. The Reynolds number of this
generalized Couette flow is defined by Re=H*u0 /n. The Couette flow
has the following analytical solution:

u=u0*sinh(r*x)/sinh(r*ly)
where r=sqrt(eps/K)
