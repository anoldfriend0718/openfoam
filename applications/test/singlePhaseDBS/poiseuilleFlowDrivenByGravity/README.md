## Physical Problems

The flow is driven by a constant force G along the channel direction. The flow is fully developed along the channel with no slip boundary condition at the top and bottom walls.Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the entrance and the exit. 
The nonlinear inertial effect due to the porous medium(Forchheimer term) is also studied. In the absence of this term, the flow at steady state is described by the following Brinkman-extended Darcy equation. The analytical solution  can be written as

u=gravity*K/nu*(1.0-cosh(r*(y-ly/2.))/cosh(r*ly/2.))
where r=sqrt(eps/K)
