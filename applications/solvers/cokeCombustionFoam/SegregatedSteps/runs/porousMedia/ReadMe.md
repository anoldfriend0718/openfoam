### Differences with the LB case

1. The flow is solved every iteraction when using DBS
2. The method to compute the reactive surface area is different
3. The reactive surface area is re-calculated every interaction. However, the LB only update the reactive surface area when one cell is burned out 
4. The coke volume is different. DBS:0.99, LB:1
