## concepts
- combustion channeling: the combustion preceed close to the outlet, which is indicated by the air leakage ratio or the outlet local coke combustion rate 
- air leakage ratio: the degree of the combustion channeling 

## Discussions on the fracture effects on the combustion dynamics at different operation conditions 
### combustion regime diagram
-  combustion regime diagram comparison between cases with the fracture or without the fracture: in terms of the combustion limited mechanism and the combustion front pattern 
-  combustion behavoir changes: uniform->uniform (may be misleading since the hetergenous coke combustion rate), facial -> cone-shaped,  wormhole in matrix -> wormhole along fractures
- highlight the combustion chaneling 

## discuss how to label the time instant of air breakthrough (combustion chaneling )
- plot the temporal profiles of the transient air leakage ratio for the cone-shaped combustion or the wormhole combustion 
- transient air leakage ratio= the air flux through the fracture/ the inlet air flux 
- identify the critical time instant in the temporal profile

### discuss the temporal air flux ratio at some representative combustion front pattern
- line plots, with x axis as the physical time, legends as different combustion regime (front pattern)
- text the time instant when the air breakthrough (combustion channeling) occurs for the cone-shaped combustion and wormholing combustion 
- discuss  O2 transport competition between the inlet-martrix and fracture-matrix 
- highlight temporal evolution before/after the combustion channeling 
- better understand the formation of different combustion front pattern at the different combustion regimes 
- possible results: the air flux ratio may increase a lot when the channeling combustion formed. The increment may enhanced with the Pe number 

### effect of combustion regime on the cumulative air flux ratio
- bar plots, with x axis as the varing regimes
- O2 contours with the air velocity vectors  
- cumulative air flux can be calculated by the numerical integration of transient air flux ratio over time
- assess the O2 transport competition between the inlet-martrix and fracture-matrix  
- better understand the formation of different combustion front pattern at the different combustion regimes 

### effect of combustion regime on the cumulative air leakeage ratio 
- bar plots, with x axis as the varing regimes
- this indictor may be less meaningful for the larger-scale combustion 
- but it can help assess the channelling degree of the combustion front. From the pore-scale perspective, increasing the air leakage ratio indicateds more oxygen break through from the fracture and bypass the other domain. Therefore, The higher air leakage ratio is  detrimental to the combustion stability, with the potential air breakthrough and less sweeping ratio at the larger scale.

## Discussions on the fracture geometerical properties

### effects of the fracture aperture on the average coke conversion rate
- scatter-line plots, with x axis as the fracture aperture and legends as the varying regimes
- the fracture aperture can increased from zero to a certain scale, such 0, domain/5, domain/4, domain/3, domain/2.
- assess the combustion rate with different frature aperture at different combustion regime
- possible results: the combustion rate may depend less on the frature aperture for the kinetics-limited regime, but the combustion rate may decrease with the fracture aperture for the tranport-limited regime due to the increasing air leakage ratio and the developed wormholing combustion 


### discuss the effect of fracture aperture on the temporal evolution of the cumulative coke conversion/transient coke combustion rate
- two figures: one for the diffusion-limited region (field operation, coned-shaped ), the other for the convection-limited regime (lab operation, wormhole-shaped)
- the fracture aperture can increased from zero to a certain scale, such  as 0, domain/4, domain/2.
- each figure: line plots (six lines), x axis as the combustion time, legend as the fracture aperture, two y axis: left for the cumulative conversion rate (X), right for the trasient coke combustion rate (dX/dt)
- highlight the coke combustion rate before/after the breakthrough
- possible results: the coke combustion rate may have signicant changes when the combustion channeling is formed



### effects of the fracture aperture on the temporal temperature profiles
- similar to the coke conversion rate
- two figures: one for the diffusion-limited region (field operation, coned-shaped ), the other for the convection-limited regime (lab operation, wormhole-shaped)
- the fracture aperture can increased from zero to a certain scale, such  as 0, domain/4, domain/2.
- each figure: line plots (3 lines), x axis as the combustion time, legend as the fracture aperture, two y axis: maximum point temperature and maximum sectional temperature 
- highlight the heat transfer dynamics before and after combustion channeling, and discuss the temperature changes with the fracture aperture 
- more insights: if poential extinction may occur at a critical aperture
