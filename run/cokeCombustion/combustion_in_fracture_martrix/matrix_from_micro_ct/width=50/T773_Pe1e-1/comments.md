## numerical tips
- some numerical instabilities occurs at the early physical time, calling for the smaller time steps


## Phenomena
- the signicant wormholing combustion front is developed. At the earlier stage, most of the combustion take plane at the fracture sides and led to the quick channeling of the combustion front along the fracture. At the later stage, the  longitudinal propogation rate of the combustion front, which is orthogonol to the fracture, is comparative to the transversal velocity, which is parallel to the air injection rate. 

- signicant air leakage leaving the domain from the fracture 

- combustion front is less extensive than T773K and Pe of 1e-2, due to the higher combustion rate and thus quicker O2 burning rate at the combustion front 

- more signicant propogration rate of the heat transfer.  

## plots 
- delineat the combustion front based on the O2 conc, and delineat the heat transfer trailing front based on the temperature, at the three reprentative time instant: (1) the time instant when channeling of the combustion front along the fracture is formed (2) the time instant after the onset of the longtidunal progration of combustion front (3) the time instant when entering the stable longtidunal and transveral propogration of the combustion front 
 

## Discussion
- maximum temperatue comparison between the case with and without fracture 

- the air flux ratio of the longitudanal plane over that of the vertical plane to demonstrate how much O2  tranversally transfer from the fracture to the matrix. It can be expected that the air flux ratio for this kind of wormhole combnustion approach to 1 

## Notes
- [p2-1] mirror the domain along the fracture in the transversal directionso that (1) the cone-shaped combustion can be more explicit in terms of visulization;
