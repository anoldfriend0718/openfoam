## numerical tips
- some numerical instabilities occurs at the early physical time, calling for the smaller time steps


## Phenomena


- cone-shaped combustion front is developed with preferential combustion near the fracture. For comparisons, the combustion front is facial pattern without the fracture 
- more hetergeneous coke combustion, with the coke near the fracture preferentially burned out 
- shorter duration to reach the setting residual coke rate: since the residual coke rate is computed as the ratio of the coke volume over the domain volume. However, the domain volume increases with the additional fracture, leading to the lower residual coke rate compared to the previous dense domain and thus the shorter duration. Additionally, it is interesting to measure and compare the effective coke combustion rate with and without fracture
-  not  serve air breakthrough at the early time, but the air leakage ratio increase with the combustion front advance near the outlet 
- temperature distribution is more heterogenous than the case without fracture. Higher combustion temperature occurred near the fracture,due to the preferential combustion and less heat capacity  close to the fracture. The heat transfer from the fracture into the domain  
-  The maximum temperature is higher than the case without the fracture
