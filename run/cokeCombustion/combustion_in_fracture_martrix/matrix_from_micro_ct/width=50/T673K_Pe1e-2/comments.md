## numerical tips
- some numerical instabilities occurs at the early physical time, calling for the smaller time steps


## Phenomena


- wholing combustion front is developed with preferential combustion near the fracture, which presents more hetergeneous coke combustion, with the coke near the fracture preferentially burned out.For comparisons, the combustion front is facial pattern without the fracture 

- the combustion front is not smooth, epecially at the earlier stage, when the combustion propogation is the least slow at the diagonal direction, due to the nature heterogeneity of the coke deposition. It can be expected the location with the rich coke deposition need more time to burn the coke out

- the combustion front is extensive than that at the higher injection rate 

- Regardless of the location near or far from the fracture, the longitudinal velocity, which is parallel to the air injection, is higher than the vertical velocity, which is orthogonol to the fracture. 

-  not  serve air breakthrough at the early time, but the air leakage ratio increase with formaton of the combustion channeling along the fracture 

- temperature distribution is more heterogenous than the case without fracture. Higher combustion temperature occurred near the fracture,due to the preferential combustion and less heat capacity  close to the fracture. The heat transfer from the fracture into the domain 

-  The maximum temperature is higher than the case without the fracture


## Plots 
- delineat the representative combustion front profile in the O2 conc or temperature contour 

## Discussion
- the air flux ratio of the longitudanal plane over that of the vertical plane to demonstrate how much O2  tranversally transfer from the fracture to the matrix
- temporal of the air flux ratio to show the O2 transport with the channeling of the combustion front 
- the volumetric coke conversion rate with time, and make comparison to the scenerio without the fracture


## Notes

- shorter duration to reach the setting residual coke rate: since the residual coke rate is computed as the ratio of the coke volume over the domain volume. However, the domain volume increases with the additional fracture, leading to the lower residual coke rate compared to the previous dense domain and thus the shorter duration. Additionally, it is interesting to measure and compare the effective coke combustion rate with and without fracture

## Improvements ideas
- [p2-1] Expand the domain in the transversal direction, and move the fracture to the axis so that (1) the wormhole combustion can be more explicit in terms of visulization; (2) more suitable for the study about the effect of the fracture orientation  on the combustion and the effect of the fracture density on the combustion front. For the study of the fracture orientation, the fracture can be put in the digonal direction 

- [p1-1] mesh analysis so that we can reduce the grid number to save the computational cost
