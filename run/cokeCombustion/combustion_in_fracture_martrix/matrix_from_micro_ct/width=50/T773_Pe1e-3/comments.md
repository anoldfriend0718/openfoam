# Comments 

## numerical tips
- some numerical instabilities occurs at the early physical time, calling for the smaller time steps


## Phenomena
- the cone-shaped combustion front is developed instead of the wormholing combustion at other scenerios with higher air injection. The  longitudinal velocity, which is orthogonol to the fracture, is much lower than the transversal velocity, which is parallel to the air injection rate.  
- less air leakage leaving the domain from the fracture unless the combustion front proceeded close to the outlet 

- combustion front is less extensive than T773K and Pe of 1e-2

- the temperature trailing front more like the facial profile with the increasing temperature near the fracture 

## plots 
- delineat the combustion front based on the O2 conc, and delineat the heat transfer trailing front based on the temperature at the two time instant: (1) the time instant when the onset (2) the time instant when stable propogation 


## Discussion
- the air flux ratio of the longitudanal plane over that of the vertical plane to demonstrate how much O2  tranversally transfer from the fracture to the matrix. It can be expected that the air flux ratio at the cone-shaped combustion is less than the wormhole combustion 


## Notes
- [p2-1] mirror the domain along the fracture in the transversal directionso that (1) the cone-shaped combustion can be more explicit in terms of visulization;
